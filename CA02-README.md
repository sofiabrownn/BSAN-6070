#Explanation
This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes in Python. The classifier is trained on a dataset of emails and predicts whether an email is spam or not based on word frequency analysis. The program processes email text, extracts relevant features, and trains a machine learning model to identify spam emails with high accuracy.
