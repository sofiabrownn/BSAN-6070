**Explanation**

This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes in Python. The classifier is trained on a dataset of emails and predicts whether an email is spam or not based on word frequency analysis. The program processes email text, extracts relevant features, and trains a machine learning model to identify spam emails with high accuracy.


**Required Libraries**
- NumPy: For numerical computations
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning models
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization
- OS: For file and directory handling
- Collections (Counter): For counting word frequencies
- Sklearn Naive Bayes: For the Multinomial Naive Bayes model
- Sklearn Metrics: For calculating model accuracy

**Software and Library Versions**
- Python 3.9+
- NumPy 1.21+
- Scikit-learn 1.0+
- Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset Info**
The dataset consists of email files stored in
- train-mails/ (Training emails)
- test-mails/ (Test emails)

**Note**:Ensure the Python notebook is in the same folder as both data sets
